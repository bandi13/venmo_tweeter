This script pulls data from Venmo's public API and finds Venmo transactions that claim to be for drugs, sex or alcohol and then tweets about it at http://twitter.com/venmodrugs

This is just for fun. Don't be mad. Also, consider changing your Venmo transcations to "private". By default all Venmo transactions are "public".
